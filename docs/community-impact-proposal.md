Now that you've [thought about your community's needs](community-assessment.md), it's time to take some action! Use this template to help you fill out your proposal. We invite you to change the contents of this template around and use the embedded tips and evaluation criteria to help you make a :sparkles: impact on your community.

## Summary of the Community's Needs

Provide a summary of what you learned from your community assessment, coupled with the feedback from others (like the opinion of other Campus Experts, community leaders, and stakeholders). 

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Community demographics**:Include data gathered from your community assessment like: the size of the community that you are targeting with your proposal, the educational background of your community, and the resources they currently have at their disposal and how accessible they are to the community.
All students that are interested in technology and hackathons at the University of Sheffield.

- **Communication**: For a community to thrive, they need to be able to communicate with each other, identify how your community prefers to communicate.
- **Culture**: Summarize the existing culture within the community you are working with.


## Your Proposal


My proposal is to do with how I am going to support those that are running the society in the future. I am not organising any longer, but I would like to help them. Much of this is on a personal level, not public.

With public work, my priority is to focus on solidifying the goals and vision of the society, and help organisers come together and work as a team.

## Your Proposal's Impact

The community needs solid leadership for the future. Future organisers need to be inspired to take hold of a vision and progress towards furthering it. As founder, I need to set out the vision clearly. A constitution of sorts, but something impactful, unlike many society constitutions.
They also need a feeling of teamwork and bonding, and I will look to do anything that makes that feeling stronger.
- Resources

Not many resources needed, I just need to sit down and think about fundamentals.
- Media

I am aiming to publish something in some form. This may be a public blog post, or a private file in the community Github organisation. This depends on how my ideas for setting the vision develop.
As for the teamwork and bonding, I will use the Github API to generate a public website of the current teams in our Github organisation.
I may do some other things if more ideas come in.
- Content knowledge
  - How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
  
    Somewhat, but there are many around the UK that are doing similar things or have done similar things that I could ask.
  - What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?
  
    Contacts.
- Timeline
  - Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.
  
  Publish the item and develop the website generation by the end of the programme.

## Planning for the Future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?

  I am aiming for defining the society purpose for the future. Impact is something that will always be evolving if the society stays on the original vision.
- How will you measure success?

  If the future society sticks with the vision or evolves it further to do great things for the community.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?

  This is going to be something I write once and do not change. It will be down to future organisers to set their visions for their time running HackSheffield.
