# To Do

1. Open a PR against this repo to share the [Community Assessment](../docs/community-assessment.md) on your fork with other Campus Experts. Please add the `community-assessment` label to your PR.
1. Review PRs with the `community-assessment` label with the goal of providing feedback to other Campus Experts, and to refine your own Community Assessment.
1. Using the feedback you gained from other experts, adjust your Community Assessment as needed and merge when ready.
1. Begin to define what you'll do to address your community's needs by filling out your [Community Impact Proposal](../docs/community-impact-proposal.md). Work on this in your fork, you'll start a PR during next week's activities to share with other Experts. Save your community impact proposal in the path `communities/YOUR-COMMUNITY/computy-impact-proposal.md`.
1. Now that you've more clearly defined what you'll do for your community, visit the [guest speaker suggestions issue](https://github.com/campus-experts/spring-2017/issues/1) once again, and review your  suggestions or provide additional ones.
1. Attend one of the office hours for this week -- the [program logistics document](../docs/logistics.md) explains what to do if you are unable to attend.
