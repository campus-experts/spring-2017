# To Do

1. Review the [program logistics document](../docs/logistics.md).
1. Fork this repo.
1. Use the [Community Assessment template](../docs/community-assessment.md) to define your community's needs. Work on this in your fork, you'll start a PR during next week's activities to share with other Campus Experts. Save your community assessment document in a folder titled `communities`, and then create an additional subfolder with the name of your community. For example, if I was creating a community assessment for Women of Color in Savannah, I'd create: `communities/woc-savannah/community-assessment.md`. If I was creating a community for London Hackers, the path would be: `communities/london-hackers/community-assessment.md`.
1. [Provide suggestions](https://github.com/campus-experts/spring-2017/issues/1) for guest speakers.
1. [Add your bio and profile picture](https://github.com/campus-experts/spring-2017/issues/2) so other Experts can get to know you.
1. Attend one of the office hours for this week -- the [program logistics document](../docs/logistics.md) explains what to do if you are unable to attend.
