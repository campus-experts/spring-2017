# Summary of the Community's Needs
  * Community demographics:  
  City Tech Society is a community of students at City, University of London who are interested in technology who are looking to learn more about technology or need help with topics covered on the Computer Science course. We have a 220 person mailing list of interested people but active members is around 20-30 but this can vary depending on the time of year.

  * Communication:  
  Right now we use the mailing list and slack for communication. We have a GitHub org for committee members to manage the website. We have a public Twitter and Facebook page for announcements to external people and a currently inactive Facebook group.

  * Culture:  
  We try to be very welcoming; we tend to keep a flat structure as far as members are concerned so nobody is worried about speaking their mind.



# Proposal

I am proposing that during society meetups we get people working on projects together. This will take place from the beginning of the academic year and go on until the end before the start of exams.

We can get people into diverse groups with members of different skill ranges, this will allow for less experienced students to learn from students who have been in university for a year or two already. Then by holding brainstorming session students will pick their projects and work on it together throughout the academic year. The City Tech Society committee will support students taking part if they need help with their projects.

As well the projects I am also aiming to get more guest speakers in to help people with new technologies that they can add to their projects or just for general discussion.

We will coordinate this by opening up the GitHub org so students can collaborate together on their projects. We will also discuss and announce through emails, Facebook and Slack.

# Planning for the Future
The proposal will be reviewed during the Christmas break to check on progress and after the end of the program we will gather feedback and discuss what improvements to make for the next year.

Success will be measured by how students feel as they have improved over the program as well as through their feedback. Due to the nature of university societies every new committee will have the task of improving/changing the program as they see fit to better help students.
