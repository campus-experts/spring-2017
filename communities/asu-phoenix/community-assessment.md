### Definition

- Students at Arizona State University and the Phoenix Area interested in growing and becoming a part of the tech community. 

### Size

- 20000+ students enrolled at Arizona State University 
    - 5,650 enrolled in Computing Program
- 200-300 at large scale hackathons    

- No target number, but want to ensure that all students, at such a large scale university, have a chance to learn more about technology and be a part of the community.

- Recently, more hackathon groups have been arising and events that are more hands on have been able to see more than hundreds of students participaring! 
    - The change is our school has become more accepting wih their new drive to be more innovative and have more of an entreprenial mindset.

    - Not at this moment, only for the individual organizations on campus
    - Computer Science Facebook group, but not many active users
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?
    - Definitely, especially one that students will actually actively use for discussion, rather than just for class guides/other less relevant activity

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
    - Our school has been starting to welcome new ideas
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
    - Difficult to resolve, groups break off, makes it difficult to create a united community
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
    - Not neccessarily 
- How will you personally handle it?
    - Try to unite the community and have an open mind and lend a hand if an organization needs one or wants to join on board and partner with the hackathon
