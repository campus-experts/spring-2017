## Summary of the Community's Needs


The community assessment helped assist with the fact that there are resources at ASU, but it seems to be disconnected. The community, especially freshmen who come to the campus are overwhelmed with the size and what the school has to offer that they never quite find what they were looking for. We spent the last semester organizing a hackathon to welcome beginners into the tech field but our organization was not the only one to do this, 2 other hackathons arised just 2 weeks apart from each other. After addressing the concern of the organizational disconnect with Joe, a more solidified idea started forming. There is a way to fortify the community and it is to connect beginners/freshmen alike to join and take part in the community to have them one day pass on the baton to the next batch. If we can bring the community together, organizations may soon follow and support each other for a thriving community.

## Your Proposal

Create a unifying way to showcase the existing organizations and tech influences to a community not only of veterns but the freshmen especially. This would involve hosting an event right after coming back from school. Currently there is a passport day that is successful to showcase ALL different clubs. There could possibly be a specific Tech centered one that really allows all those interested in Tech to see all the different opportunities of involvement they themselves can have in the ASU/Phoenix community. 


- **Timing**: 

| Week |Title|Description| 
|:----:|:-------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   3  | Research Past Events/Choose Event Type | Understand which freshmen/beginner friendly events work best. Large Scale Hackathon? University Wide Tech Day? 
|   4-5  |  Research/Recruitment of current  Freshmen/Sophomores, Faculty, Organizations      | We currently have joined forces with one hackathon team, start having people more involved |
|   6  | Create a Timeline of event planning process | Have a structured plan and task list in order to assess what should be done over summer to have a successful back to school event|
- **Community demographics**: On the school front, planning on reaching out to more organizations within the school and faculty members that are heavily involved. On the company front, reach out to past companies that were involved and be more involved with hackerrnest socials to discover new potentially interested community partners. 
- **Goals**: 
    - Understanding and Aligning the interests and goals of different components in the community
        - Students 
        - Organizations
        - Faculty/School 
        - Companies  
- **Communication**: Facebook has proven to be helpful when connecting the computer science community here, Maybe for clubs an overall Google Drive. Would love any reccomendations!
