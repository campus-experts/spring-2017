## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
Students at Aston University studying/interested in Computer Science or related subjects, and seeking help with the course or to learn more than is covered in their course.

### Size

- How many people are currently in your community?

Around about 120 listed members (although not certain on this), but many do not regularly attend events. Probably about 30 semi-regulars.

- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?

I'd like to get all of those 120 to be attending most of our events!

- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?

It has been roughly similar as far as I've known, but the active members have declined over the past year due to the previous committee not doing much in the way of interesting/useful events.

### Resources

- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?

There is the course (of course! ᕕ(ȍ‿‿ȍ)ᕗ), but that tends to be pretty dry. There are many members of our society who are good at teaching others, and spreading their knowledge, however that's not frequently utilised. We're aiming to take advantage of this a bit more over the coming year.

- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?

We frequently attend hackathons as a group (although the turnout is usually not amazing). We went through a phase of hosting office hours (although not by that name), but turnout was often low so we stopped. I think this was mainly because of total lack of structure, and also no real motivation to attend (lots of people do not really do side projects). We also host AstonHack, which gets loads of new people involved!

### Accessibility

- How accessible are the current resources in your community?

Very. Although we are technically a paid society, we allow anybody to attend our events. I'm hoping to keep it this way, despite the student union wanting to enforce everybody being a member.

- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?

We try to vary when we hold events, but mostly stick with a Wednesday evening (and sometimes Friday evening for socials). Most students shouldn't be working around then!

- Is there childcare available?

No, although this is mostly not applicable to our community. As far as I'm aware this doesn't impact any members.

### Interests

- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?

We have a majority make up of CS students, but also have members from other engineering subjects and also business students. It might be nice to get a wider range, but business students in particular regularly show little interest in learning much about tech, but are there to find a sidekick for their app idea! This is of course a generalisation, but from experience quite an accurate one at Aston.

- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?

Like most groups of people, they have a wide range of interests, but the one topic which brings them together is technology. I think it makes sense for us to stick with this, as it's what people expect.

### Goals

- Why do people get involved in your community?

To get help with the course, to learn something new, and to socialise with others on their course. Those are what I can think of off the top of my head. We particularly see a lot of involvement from those who already have a good understanding of the course content, and are seeking something to stretch themselves with.

- Are they students hoping to get a degree?

Yes.

- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?

We do hold company sponsored tech talks (read: employment scouting events).

- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?

Yes! In fact, we sometimes see members from outside of the CS degree being more excited about some of the stuff we're running than those doing the degree! I think this is partly because we seem to have many people doing CS at Aston who kind of drifted into it
- they don't really have much passion and are almost just in it for the money. Maybe we should aim to increase interest in more subjects outside of the course.

- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?

Continue hosting weekly events! I was part of a push around February to get a regular schedule of events going, and I'd like to keep it up. Also make sure revision sessions run
- these have been really useful for many members in the past, but we unfortunately didn't run them in January due to lack of people willing to host them.

### Location

- Where does your community currently gather?

We have a Facebook group which gets a lot of activity from our regulars, and also an actual, physical society room (we always have, but this year we got a super-duper new one!) which again, gets many of the regulars. We also sometimes see non-members in there who have been brought in by a friend or for group project or something.

- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?

See above (we have a room).

- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?

Yes, and no. But this is not really relevant for most members.

- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?

People are usually already in the University building so not applicable. We are a 10 minute (Scott pace) walk from the central train stations in Birmingham for those not on campus. Very accessible.

- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?

Yes, see above.

- How much does it cost to use the space?

Totally free!

- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?

It has a whole load of chairs and tables, but they're all on legs and can be moved about very easily (and are regularly). We can expand the space if needed, and occupy the student software company office (there's a big double door that opens up to join the two). The room has a projector and speakers.

- How many people can it fit?

I've never tried to cram it full before, but maybe 30 people before it gets too much. And that's a bit of a squeeze. As a result, we quite often book out other rooms in the University for larger events. This works pretty well, especially now that we've got a contact in the department who's happy to book rooms for us any time, in an instant!

- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?

Yes. We can also steal sofas from the lobby outside (haven't thought about trying this yet, will report back on whether we get told off or not).

- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

All kinds, yes! We usually buy some for organised events, but for the rest of the time, there are cups for water, a kettle, and a cafeteria/vending machines for food.

### Communication

- How does your community get in touch with one another?

At the moment, by word of mouth and in our Facebook group. The committee uses a Slack team.

- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?

We have a mailing list through the student union (but it's a pain to use). There's also a GitHub organisation, but it's not really used. We have various social accounts for posting news/advertising events (Facebook, Twitter).

- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

I've just stepped in as head of the society, and one of the first things I'm hoping to do is open up our Slack team to all members. At the moment it's just the committee, and it needs a bit of a tidy up before making it open!

### Culture

- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?

There are certainly people who try to be welcoming (I consider myself one), but the society as a whole is ripe with inside jokes and memes. I really don't like this culture, and we're going to try and get rid of over the next year (not 100% sure on a plan to go about this yet though).

- What happens if there is a disagreement?

We try to settle it outside of any politics. The majority of disagreements are trivial (although it's important to recognise when this is not the case). If politely talking about it doesn't come up with a solution, then the student union has a procedure to follow for formal complaints (I'm not sure on it, and I don't think it has ever happened over the lifetime of the society, but perhaps I should learn it).

- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?

See above.

- How will you personally handle it?

Also see above. For me, the society is something personal, and so I'll try and solve it without being "official".
