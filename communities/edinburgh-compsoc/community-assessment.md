## Assessing Your Community's Needs


### Definition
We try to create a home of diverse culture and provide an open-minded community for all students from a range of backgrounds within our
society and the university. CompSoc does not limit ourselves within the department of Informatics, gender, race or experience etc., and 
welcomes everyone who has an interest in the mechanics that happen within today’s technology. In an ideal situation, we would like to 
reach out to even more people and not just students, who are interested in technology. At the moment, we have already taken certain 
steps to reach out to high-school students and students who aren't in the IT sector by means of workshops and extracurricular 
activities.


### Size
Currently the society consists of around 300-400 students, some graduates and/or working members (this number includes inactive members 
as well). Wanting to attract even more attention and taking into account some feedback, we began creating events that attempt to target 
a variety of different students such as tech talks, workshops, game nights, socials and such.


### Resources
We hold our monthly STMU, a tech-talk provided to members to discuss the latest news regarding informatics. Our talks would usually be 
given by different guests we invite from a range of companies, students and lecturers which provides us an insight on their work 
with technology. Members are also able to discuss and ask questions afterwards over our complimentary pizza! In addition, we also 
organise our own hackathon Hack the Burgh, which is becoming one of our most popular events of the year with students all over the UK 
and even from further away.

In the future we hope to do more step-by-step workshops and beginner friendly introductions to coding and introduce some tools that our 
members find fun and interesting to work with.


### Accessibility
Almost all of our activities are free to take part in and we welcome non-students as well. Usually they take place in the evenings 
of a weekday, but there are also certain events we hold over the weekend. Depending on the requests of members we can also do video 
recordings of events and later share with everyone. 


### Interests
The majority of our members are doing a Computer Science or closely related degree. However, the society is open to everyone 
and hence we do have some members who are either not studying at the moment or are doing a completely different degree. Although we do 
present ourselves as mainly focusing within the tech sector, our topics mainly relate to technology and things to do with it, we do  
branch out and organise fun activities such as scavenger hunts or pub crawls in order to cater to everyone's differences and to allow 
members to socialise and forget about work.


### Goals
Usually we are the group of people where others can talk about their interests and find like-minded people. Some come to our events
to talk with people from companies, while others just enjoy the atmosphere and spend their time in an enjoyable environment. 
When we do workshops or hands-on activities, it’s usually for people who want to learn something new or share their skills with others. 


### Location
The main space of our regular meet-ups is located within the central campus. It is easily accessible by students and non-students alike 
on certain days or for events as long as they are part of our society. We make sure that the spaces are big enough to host large 
audiences and the university provides us the space for free. There are all the necessary AV tools and the space can be easily shift for 
a reorganised for a talk or an interactive presentation. In some cases, we uses other areas around our campus if we need a different 
working space for workshops or a  competition (coding, quiz etc.) and almost all of them we can access for free as well as cater to 
everyone's accessibility needs.


### Communication
To get in touch with our members we mostly post on our Facebook page and group as well as sending out a monthly newsletter with all
our upcoming events and activities. Twitter is used less, but we hope to increase that next year alongside other chat channels like IRC
and Slack. 


### Culture
Because our society is originally run by students and we don't have any specific requirements to join, we welcome everyone who's 
interested in what we do or even if they want to take part in the socials or outings without any technological background. We have a 
constitution that points out our main aims and goals as well as what our members can expect. There are also certain agreements with our 
Student Union making us an official society organised by the students. Because we change our head committee annually, there's always a 
flow of new ideas and changes to what we do. In cases that something is disagreed upon, we discuss this matter with pros and cons within 
the committee first, which has minutes taken for every meeting we hold, and if we can't reach a consensus, we will reach out to our 
members and decide what to do with more opinions. It is also worth noting that our meetings are publicly announced and everyone is 
welcome to join us – to participate or just spectate.
