# Assessing Your Community's Needs

### Glossary

BCU: Birmingham City University
CEBE: The computing faculty at BCU
SU: Student's union (Birmingham City University Students Union)

## Definition :page_with_curl:

[HaCS](https://hacs.tech) (Hackathon and Computing Society at BCU) members and other local university participants. HaCS tries to operate as openly as possible and regularly invites students from the surrounding universities to events.

## Size :chart_with_upwards_trend:

- How many people are currently in your community?
  - We have ~130 registered society members through the students union, which receive weekly newsletter updates. We also have 300+ members in our [Facebook group](https://facebook.com/groups/hacs). Facebook is a mix of many other university students as well as a subset of our registered members. Of the 130 registered members ~20 are highly active within the community and of the 130 we get 15-30 attending our weekly events. Attendance for weekly events varies and it is not always the same 15-30 subset.
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
  - I would like our active numbers to go up to 50 or 70 really active members from our university. I believe theres allot of hidden talent and enthusiasm to be found at BCU with a yearly intake of 300 undergrads into computer science and related subjects.
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
  - Historically we have had roughly the same percentage of registered vs active members. We have seen growth since year 1 from 60 to 130 and we are now moving into year 3.

## Resources :computer:

- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
  - There are our own workshops that we run, university library resources, hackathons and Birmingham/Midlands meetups. There are also university/department run workshops and events that happen throughout the term.

- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
  - Yes. There are three student run hackathons (BrumHack, AstonHack and BullHacks). There are also many me meetups by companies and communities in the area such as Tech Wednesdays (run by an incubator type office space), Brum JS (Javascript community regularly hosted by Talis) and many others.

## Accessibility :wheelchair:

- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
  - Pretty accessible so long as you are a BCU student. There are some extra hoops we have to jump through to accommodate for non BCU students.

- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
  - Not so far. We've always kept to meetups towards the end of the working day or after. We are planning to run more earlier however.

- Is there childcare available?
  - No, this is a hot topic at SU meetings.
- Is there accessibility for people with disabilities?
  - Yes, elevators and other modern facilities to accommodate.

## Interests :telescope:
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
  - A majority of members are CS or related. We do have many networking students from the same faculty. We are actively trying to accommodate more faculties and disciplines. One of our targets is to get many more Arts and media tech students coming to our events. We run many beginner friendly web development type workshops and have many talented web developers that could help them share their creativity on the web!

- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
  - Main interest is definitely tech. There is also allot of interest in video games so we try to run lans too.

## Goals :dart:

- Why do people get involved in your community?
  - To meet fellow course mates in a more relaxed student lead atmosphere. To make new friends and to learn about new and interesting technologies and workflows.

- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
  - I hope so. Yes.

- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
  - To a degree. One of our core aims is to introduce more people to the fun nature of the degree they've selected.

- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
  - Employability is a big one. Just generally to get our members out of the university grind and into real fun projects.

## Location :earth_africa:

- Where does your community currently gather?
  - Mondays at the pub for our weekly social and Wednesdays during our workshops. We rarely see everyones faces at once however.

- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
  - Nope. We try to facilitate in person meetups as much as possible. On campus and at hackathons

- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
  - Yes more than you could ever need. Mostly paid.

- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
  - Yes. Also a plethora of options. Two stations with direct connections to the whole of the UK and even a really super fast one soon in the future one day maybe.

- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
  - Yes, although more accessible to those on campus. We have noticed reduced attendance and willingness to stay long hours after lectures when students aren't immediately local

- How much does it cost to use the space?
  - `int cost = 0;` But booking of space within 2 weeks required. We have a permanent booking for our weekly rooms and regularly book out the local pub for free also.

- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
  - Flexible, all types of events are possible. From conferences to workshops.

- How many people can it fit?
  - Depends widely. Our regular rooms could comfortably accommodate 30. We have access to much larger rooms and lecture halls

- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
  - `return True`

- Is there water or snacks available nearby?
  - Yes, water fountains and vending machines are always open. Canteen is normally empty.

## Communication :loudspeaker:

- How does your community get in touch with one another?
  - Facebook pretty much exclusively. We do have a newsletter but thats one way communication.

- Is there an email group, a GitHub organisation, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
  - Yes, all of the above. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hacsbcu/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hacsbcu), @HaCSBCU, [Web](https://hacs.tech)

- Could your organisation benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?
  - We will use whatever the majority use and is effective

## Culture :performing_arts:

- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
  - Yes please! In fact, why not join our [Facebook](https://hacs.tech/) group right now!

- What happens if there is a disagreement?
  - We do our best to all conduct ourselves appropriately as adults. We are also working towards creating and implemneting a [code of conduct](https://github.com/HaCSBCU/conduct) for all interactions

- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
  - We have a manifesto and many other official documents. The boring SU documentation stuff is accessible in our committee slack and on the BCU moodle portal.
