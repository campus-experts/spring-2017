## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
- The current community at Sussex is fragmented into computer science year groups, with very little cross year communication (or small groups left from HackSoc).
- Ideally every year group will be able to communicate to anyone else throughout the school of computer science.
- I plan on beginning this by creating social media groups that can join these fragments together.

### Size
- The community is about 20 or so people, with low activity and low engagement.
- Ideally I'd like to see 100 students from all aspects of CS and it's year groups able to communicate with one another.
- By implementing some social media groups and getting the word out to the members of the smaller fragmented groups, I will hopefully be able to pull these together to create a larger base.

### Resources
- Hackathon society, external makerspace, occasional meetups, maybe a hackathon (and to a lesser extent a "Peer Assisted Learning" (PAL) program).
- Ideally I would like to see workshops and talks come about to help increase interest in the community and foster communication between the members.
- I am working on talks and workshops to present to the students and I will need to find some willing leaders to help do the same.

### Accessibility
- Society is accessible to students of Sussex.
- Makerspace meets on Thursdays after 8 for drop-ins or more availability for members.
- Meetups aren't run by students.
- Hackathon is organised by the society, but currently infrequent in nature.

### Interests
The community is only CS students, but I would like to see this grow and become accessible to students of all degrees, with an interest in technology. For now, I will be focusing on the CS students.

### Goals
- Currently the community only has an interest in getting a degree and a job.

- The PAL sessions help with the degree aspect.
- I will look into asking companies to come and do a talk, with recruitment help after.

### Location
Currently the location is online only.

Questions to answer;
- Where does your community currently gather?
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
- How much does it cost to use the space?
- How many people can it fit?
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

### Communication
- Currently; Barely active Facebook and Whatsapp chat.
- Ideally; Active groups/chats.

### Culture
- Currently the community is inward facing. Few attempts have been made to branch across the year gaps.
- The community is welcoming to those that make an attempt, but doesn't make an external effort.
- Spaces on campus are extremely flexible. Rooms are available from small workshop rooms, to large lecture theatres.

-- Policies or procedures?  
A code of conduct exists for HackSoc, and I would like to incorporate this into the community as a standard.

-- How will you personally handle it?  
Moderating. Users will be warn/banned if they fail to follow the rules.

-- What happens if there is a disagreement?  
In the event of a breach of the code of conduct, users will be warned/banned, failing a breach, the issue will be looked into, but if no wrong doing has happened, I would ask that they refrain from communicating. Follow ups will be made.
