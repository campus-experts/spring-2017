## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
- The current community I am a part of is hackers at Sussex University.
- Ideally this will grow to a community in and around Brighton (to connect the two universities in that area).

### Size
- The community is about 20 or so people, with low activity and low engagement.
- I would ideally like to see a larger number of students to get involved with more frequent events to foster engagement.
The group is still less than a year old, probably 6 months and has been lacking in community leaders.
- I would like to create a community run online space where the community is in charge of its own growth. By which I would like to see anyone, society or individuals, able to create and run events how they see fit and make this accessable to anyone interested.

### Resources
Hackathon society, external makerspace, occasional meetups, maybe a hackathon.
I would like to see hardware resources and hardware and software workshops and consistant meetups to share ideas.

### Accessibility
Society is accessable to students of Sussex. Makerspace meets on thursdays after 8 for dropins or more availability for members.
Meetups aren't run by students. Hackathon is organised by the society, but currently infrequent in nature.

### Interests
The community is only CS students, but I would like to see this grow and become accessable to students of all degrees, with an interest in technology. For now, I will be focusing on the CS students.

### Goals
Students hoping to get a degree and some trying to ramp-up to get a job
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?

### Location
Currently the location is online only.

- Where does your community currently gather?
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
- How much does it cost to use the space?
- How many people can it fit?
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

### Communication
Facebook and Whatsapp chat.

### Culture
Currently the community is inward facing. It has been described as Cliqu√©-y and uninviting.
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
The group at present in unflexable and this needs work. Available space however is extremely flexable, on campus.
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?

- Policies or procedures?
A code of conduct exists for HackSoc, and I would like to incorperate this into the community as a standard

- How will you personally handle it?
Unsure.
