## Summary of the Community's Needs

- **Community demographics**: Include data gathered from your community assessment like: the size of the community that you are targeting with your proposal, the educational background of your community, and the resources they currently have at their disposal and how accessible they are to the community.
  - I will be targeting a community of >50 members, primarily those within the computer science department at Sussex university, which is often low knowledge of things outside of accademia. Resources are scarce and will require petitioning of the societies, lecturers and professionals around Brighton and Sussex to help contribute to this.
- **Communication**: Historically they have communicated through Facebook and WhatsApp.
- **Culture**: Memes and gifs? Whiteguys? I'm not sure how to answer this...


## Your Proposal

With this project I will be aiming to create a community targeted at students interested in computer science and tech. Using the existing communities of 2 societies that had high interest but low engagement I will attempt to join them together into a community driven by its members and not by the societies. This allows the societies to have as much or as little engagement with the community without being the reason the community succeeds or fails.

- **Community demographics**: The aim is to create a community from almost nothing, which is the initial growth. Hopefully this initial program can help bring to light local members who would be capable of helping grow the community. I would like to see a community of 50 members within the first 6 weeks, growing to 80 by the end of the term (I am not expecting this to be all active members).
- **Goals**: To create a self-sustaining community that cana be influenced but not driven by university societies, and to bridge a gap that can lead to shared resources with Sussex's neighbouring university (Brighton).
- **Communication**: We will begin with online communication and hopefully a meeting space, the exact nature of the meeting space is yet to be decided.
- **Timing**: A few weeks prep before the begining of the new acedemic term, and a several weeks of targeted advertising of events to help demonstrate activity.
  - **Events are unplanned at this time and need more research.**


## Your Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish.
Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - Students with interests in computing and other technologies.
- Community needs
  - The joining of existing and fragmented (or dormant) communities created by the tech societies of Sussex.
- Resources
  - Willing community leaders
  - Unsure. Will look into ways to draw out students who could become active members or community leaders within the university.
- Media
  - How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?
  - What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?
- Content knowledge
  - I have a fledgling knowledge of creating a community from information I have picked up and my previous attempts to create a community.
  - The other campus experts would be a great resource to learn from as many of them have created or heavily impacted their own communities prior to this program.
- Timeline
  - 8 weeks -> 12 weeks
  - **Content may be produced; more research required.**

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- Periodically. Week 4, 6, 8 and 12 would all be good times to analyse the progress.
- Numbers of students that have joined the community would be a good measure of success
- If this succeeds, I would like to attempt a follow up version with on a larger scale, looking for more leaders and more content to create better engagement.
