## Summary of the Community's Needs

- **Community demographics**: Currently a very small community of about 5 people, we aim to grow to  150 people during the next academic year. Our community will include anyone with a passion for tech and an interest in working on passion projects outside of academia, regardless of their educational background. Currently the community doesn't have many resources available, except for LauzHack which was organized with the aim of kick starting the community.


- **Communication**: At the moment communications are direct messages between members by email/IM, but as the community grows a Facebook group and Slack channel will be introduced as required.

- **Culture**: At the moment, we don't have any meetups or regular group activity so it has been hard to develop a community culture. People pretty much work on their own individual projects and interactions are limited to asking for help if and when needed.

## Your Proposal

Launching a new student association at EPFL for the community, and organizing regular meet-ups for the members of the association.

- **Timing**: For us the key timing will be the start of the next semester. We would ideally like to setup an official university association by the end of the summer, thereby enabling us to pitch the associations at the associations fair at the start of the academic year. This will be key to letting people (especially first years) know that we exist and how to get in touch with us. Soon after this we would start weekly/monthly meetups for the community to bond and get comfortable with other members. The idea behind these meetups is to give community members the chance to learn something cool and new, and also be able to discuss any issues they are dealing with. Such meetups will also be ideal for promoting hackathons and encouraging traveling to hackathons all over Europe.

- **Community demographics**: We definitely want to increase the size of the community many fold. To do so the first step is to become an official university association. Following this, our main outreach would be through word-of-mouth as people who enjoy being a part of the community will hopefully tell their friends about it. While this is a great form of 'organic growth', the community might lack diversity as theres a high probability that most people who join us will only be from a computer science background. In order to attract people with more diverse backgrounds we will reach out to other departments in the university (not just Computer Science).

- **Goals**:
  - My goals were for community members to learn something new, and to work on 'side-projects' on their own/with friends.
  - The proposal helps meet these goals in the following ways:
    - Forming the association enables us to formally create the support structure for community members to meet their goals.
    - Community members will (hopefully) learn something new at the meetups
    - We will promote hackathons through the association, as hackathons are a great place to both get started with a side-project and to learn something new over a weekend.
    - By 'socializing' with people with the same passion for tech, community members are more likely to work with each other.
    - With a diverse range of experiences within the community (hopefully), anyone who needs help should be able to find someone who can guide them.

- **Communication**:
  - Meetups: Main form of interaction on a regular basis
  - Facebook group: Easy way to reach out to many people, available for any posts that community members find useful/interesting/relevant. A bit like a localized version of HH:EU. Can also be used to make announcements.
  - Slack: For more focused communication. Will probably not be in active use for announcements, etc but will be useful for creating local communities. For example need help with Python, ping the python channel on slack - all people interested in Python will be there.


## Your Proposal's Impact

- Target audience
  - Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal?
    - I'm expecting to impact the students at EPFL who are interested in tech but don't know how to start to dabble with it.
- Community needs
  - What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?
    - With this proposal, I aim to give students the support structure they need to pursue their passion projects.
- Resources
  - What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?
    - A lot of patience to deal with the red tape in setting up a new association
    - Venue for meetups
    - Perhaps some swag to give an incentive to newbies to come for the first time.
  - How will you obtain those resources?
    - We can get the venue from the university
    - For swag we'll try to get some sponsors.
- Media
  - During meetups:
    - Presentations/demos
    - Live coding
    - Guest talks by interesting people (if possible)

- Content knowledge
  - How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
    - I can't say that I am the most knowledgeable when it comes to talks. I can cover a few areas, but can't cover everything on my own.
    - I am very knowledgeable on how to convince people to go to hackathons though :D
  - What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?
    - People! Different people have different skill sets. So the person who has alot of experience in a topic will 'lead' the meetup which is about the corresponding topic.
- Timeline
  - Mid September (week 1 of semester): Setup student association
  - Mid October (~week 4 of semester): have first meet up
  - November 10-12 (~week 8 of semester): LauzHack 2.0

## Planning for the Future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
  - Probably in December at the end of the semester. We'll have enough information to tell if the community has grown.
- How will you measure success?
  - Number of regular attendees at meetups
  - Number of members attending hackathons
  - Volume of interactions online
  - Member happiness - ideally by talking to community members try to get an idea if they are benefiting from the community. Although surveys would be easier.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
  - Probably once a semester. Its too hard to tell if something worked or not in the short term.
