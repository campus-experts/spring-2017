## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community: 
  City Tech Society is a community of students at City, University of London who are interested in technology who are looking to learn more about technology or need help with topics covered on the Computer Science course.
  
### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
We have a 220 person mailing list of interested people but active members is around 20-30 but this can vary depending on the time of year.
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
Ideally I would like for the community to have 50 or so active and contributing members all year round.
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
Historically there have been similiar groups on campus but they folded as soon as the individual running it has graduated.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
Being is London provides quite a vast amount of resources for people to learn more about tech and one of our main aims is to help our members get more information about them and hopefully attend some that may interest them.
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
Apart from the actual Computer Science course there are countless external meetups for people to attend. Our university's careers and entrepreneurship departments host seminars very regularly. Every Monday we meet up to discuss tech, play games and have a small workshop session. Hackathons are also another focus of our community, we attend many across the London and sometimes in other parts of the UK. We also hosted our own hackathon, HackCity this year.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
Resources are very accessible, they are shared with everyone regradless of whether they could make the sessions or if they are a paid member of the Students Union or not.
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
We try to hold our meetings out of lecture time the first term we held them on Thursday evenings but this term we moved to Monday evenings. We also try to encourage people to drop in when they can if they are busy and miss the first half etc. 

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
The majority of our community is made up of Computer Sciecne students but we have some members who are students in related fields such as Data Science and some students who come from completely different subject backgrounds. 
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
Members of our community are mostly first year Computer Science students who have no specific subject interest as of yet so they are very open to other topics. On the otherhand we have quite a few members who study on the Games Technology course who tend to only be interested in games development related events. 

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
People get involved in our community because they want to learn more about tech / CS, or they will like more support with the Computer Science course. 
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
Yes
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
Members on from the Computer Science course do sometimes use the community to learn more about roles in tech and ask questions from older members.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
The students that we see from non CS degrees tend to be more passionate about developing whereas some of our CS students fail to make the distiction between coursework and working on their own projects and do sometimes see developing as a chore.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
We are looking into working on a project together as a community, whether it be a website or game. This will be inviting to members who want to develop more as well as CS students who want to work on their portfolio. 

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
We usually gather in a room in the CS department. We are looking to get a permanent space for meeting in the future.
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
Students are usually already on campus for gatherings but our campus is in Central London so it can be accessed by the tube or bus easily. 
- How much does it cost to use the space?
Spaces are free to use.
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
Depending on the type of event being held we book a different room. So for weekly meetups or workshops we book a classroom but if we need more capacity we can book a lecture theatre. 
- How many people can it fit?
Our normal rooms can fit around 30 people, lecture theatres can fit upwards of 150 poeple.
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
We tend to use classrooms which have more comfortable seating and a better set up for our events compared to a lecture theatre.
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?
Water is available nearby on campus and there are shops very close to the university. We also bring a small number of snacks to the meetups when we can and cater for larger events such as hackdays. 

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
Right now we use the mailing list and slack for communication. 
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
We have a GitHub org for committee members to manage the website. We have a public Twitter and Facebook page for accouncements to external people and a currently inactive Facebook group.
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?
We are in discussions of a platform to move onto from Slack to get more engagement from members. 

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
We are very welcoming, we tend to keep a flat structure as far as members are concerned so nobody is worried about speaking their mind.
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
Disagreements are usually very trivial but myself or one of the committee members will step in to moderate. Things can also be escalated to either the Department of Computer Science or the Students Union.
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
As a part of the Students Union they have policies and procedures set in place to follow in case of any disagreements. We also have a constitution that outlines our goals, structure and procedures.
