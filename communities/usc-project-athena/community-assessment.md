# University of Southern California - Project Athena

### Definition
- Females at USC or in the Southern California area who are interested in coding and tech

### Size
- In April, we're hosting AthenaHacks, a hackathon to give this community an open and collaborative environment to build and learn new things. We had over 1000 applicants apply, and 400 RSVP'd.
- I would like this community to be as big as possible to give everyone a wide-spread community of friends and connections.
- Project Athena is in its first year, so ideally would like it to grow continuously.

### Resources
- There are a few CS-related clubs on campus, such as Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Women in Computing (WiC), Girls in Tech (GiT). 
- Clubs like ACM host a small hackathon every semester, and offer weekly workshops such as interview prep or web development.

### Accessibility
- The current technical resources are focused on CS majors on a whole (like ACM). GiT and WiC are focused on creating a community, but don't offer technical workshops for females in CS.
- Meetings are usually held at night since most students have class during the day.

### Interests
- The community is heavily dominated by CS students, but there have been students who are interested in coding, or having a CS minor.
- I hope that the community will also talk about impostor syndrome and the environment of the tech world for females.  

### Goals
- People get involved on campus to set themselves up for success in the future (ie. grad school, work)
- The students are all hoping to complete their degree, and most want to work in industry.
- Regardless of major, they are passionate about developing and learning new things.
- Activities such as hackathons, group projects, and workshops can be implemented to set the community up for success.

### Location
- Classrooms for meetings can be booked on USC's campus.
- Community will meet in person and meetings can be recorded and posted online for those who cannot make it

### Communication
- The community stays in touch through the Facebook group and the slack. 
- Email will be used for communication between the community and the organizing team.

### Culture
- This community will be welcoming to all ideas and beliefs. There will be a 0% harrassment policy since this is supposed to be an open forum for women in tech to be themselves.
- If there is a disagreement, things will be talked out peacefully between the parties until it is resolved.
- The organizing team has written out a policy of how the club/community should be run.
- Personally, I will oversee any community activities to make sure everyone is feeling safe and happy.
