# Summary of the Community's Needs
  * Community demographics:
    * Females at USC or in the Southern California area who are interested in coding and tech
    * At our all female hackathon in April 2017, we hosted over 310 hackers!
    * Most attendees were from colleges such as USC, UCSD, UCI and UCLA
    * We had 40 high schoolers attend as well.
  * Communication:
    * The community stays in touch through the Facebook group and the slack.
    * Email will be used for communication between the community and the organizing team.
  * Culture:
    * The community is heavily dominated by CS students, but there are also students who are interested in coding, or have a CS minor.
  
# Proposal
  * Timing:
    * We'd like to host another hackathon next spring, hopefully in February. 
    * We would also like to host talks, workshops, and a women's conference in the fall semester.
  * Community demographics:
    * We're planning on increasing our community size, and we will use social media and campus ambassadors from other schools to help spread the word of our organization and events.
  * Goals:
    * People get involved on campus to set themselves up for success in the future (ie. grad school, work)
    * The students are all hoping to complete their degree, and most want to work in industry.
    * Regardless of major, they are passionate about developing and learning new things.
    * Activities such as hackathons, group projects, and workshops can be implemented to set the community up for success.
  * Communication:
    * The community will stay in touch through our Facebook group, and the slack that was created for AthenaHacks 2017.

# Planning for the Future
 I'd like to review the impact of this proposal in the USC Project Athena community through feedback from our events and attendance at our events. I would like to continuously go through the community plans every semester, and hope that when I graduate, the community will keep thriving.
