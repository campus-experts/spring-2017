# UNAM Engineering 
[UNAM Engineering](https://github.com/unamfi) is a small Github organization started on 2016 with the objective to provide students a space
where they were able to share the projects they have been developing on their classes and hackathons, tools and tips for other students. We
promote students to go to meetups and various event, help them prepare for job/internship opportunities and provide office hours.

### Definition

- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community: 
  - Students interested in developing projects in their free time.
  - Students already working on research and/or developing apps.
  - Students interested to attend hackathons and meetups.
  - Students interested in landing internship opportunities.
  - Students interested in meeting industry companies and people.

  
### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?

Currently there's 45 people on the GitHub organization and around 10 people have submitted repos.

- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?

Getting to 150 people in the organization and having a 20% - 25% members contributing.

- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?

The group grew a lot in the beginning and people used to share they're code. After four months the growth
stopped because we didn't promote it outside of our core friends. Usually, the last couple months of the semester
we get a lot of traffic from students looking for final projects done on previous years.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?

We have some guides and projects done in the organization which help students understand the topics they see
in their classes as well as some small courses.

- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?

Currently, we don't promote meetups nor seminars nor hackathons but is something we look forward to do. We have online tools. 
We do office hours but not in an organized structure. Most of the time students come to the lab and ask for help.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?

All of the community resources are open sourced.

- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?

We don't hold meetups so far.

- Is there childcare available?

We don't have childcare available.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that

As a community we're open to anyone who wants to join though a bast mayority are computer engineers.

- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific

We're open to projects that are related to CS or CE so we might talk about other topics and how people 
solved them with code.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community

Most of the people that join is to share their code with the organization or to ask for code exmaples about
their classes.

Yes, most of them. We also have graduates as part of the community.

Most are looking for internships for summer/winter.

- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major

Yes, we have also psychologist and law students that love to code.

- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals

  - Sharing Code.
  - Learning from other students.
  - Students meeting each other.
  - Building a public "Portfolio" of the projects that students are making in the univesity.


### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?

We talk via FB Messenger and Github. 

- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?

It is online so far though we could meet at the lab I'm working in.

- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?

There's public parking close though it's highly saturated.

- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?

Yes, we are connectd to the two main public transportation systems in Mexico.

- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?

It's accesible for both.

- How much does it cost to use the space?

For students the spaces are free you just need to ask for it which sometimes can be a long process.

- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?

For meetups and presentations in general is preaty flexible. for hackathons is more complicated and, so far,
we haven't been able to organize one on campus.

- How many people can it fit?

Depends on the space you ask for. It goes from 40-160 and in special occations you can get a 440 space.

Yes

We use FB Messenger and in rare ocations GH issues. 

- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?

We have the Github organization as the main contact form.

- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

Yes we could. We could explore better ways to connect al members.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?

We're open to new people and ideas.

- What happens if there is a disagreement?

We usually don't have disagreements. In the worst case escenario we vote for the best solution and include memebers.

- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?

We don't have many policies and they're on a Github Repo.

- How will you personally handle it?

We need to improve how the GH organization is structured to make it more transparent in policies and procedures.
