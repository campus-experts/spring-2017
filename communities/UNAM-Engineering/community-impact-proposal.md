# Comunity Impact UNAM Engineering

## Summary of the Community's Needs

After holding a several conversations with some members of the Computer
Engineering School, I was able to get a deeper understanding on some core
points the community has been looking for or found missing in their period
as students. The topics that were discussed the most were: 
  1. **Design and Develop Algorithms**.
  2. **Develop Real-life apps** (Experience).
  3. **Public Speaking** (Soft Skills in General).
  4. **Meeting Industry Leaders and Companies** (Aspirational Figures and Trayectories).
  5. **Leadership**
  6. **What to do after graduation?** (Work/Masters/?)
  7. **Resume and Interview practices**


### Community demographics
  - **Size**: 42 Registered Members; 10 members sharing repos.
  - **Age**: 18-30 years.
  - **Main Backgrounds**: Computer Engineers, Computer Scientists.
  - **Secondary Backgrounds**: Psicologists, Lawyers, etc.
  - **Resources**:
    - **People**: We have students we lots of expierience and freshmen as well.
    Also we have some teachers who mainly work on open source.
    - **Github Organization**: Our main platform it allows us to achieve our
    goals. It allows discussiones, code shaing and information gathering.

### Communication
We usually communicate in private FB Messages or via Github Issues.

### Culture
We strongly believe that opening school projects gives others the posibility to
learn from others. We're open to have a diverse community based on the will to learn
and share. We know that students on the campus are developing projects and research 
papers that should be proudly shown to others outside the university.


## Proposal
What we're looking for in the first month of the project is to have a well
stablished structure on the Github Organization that would allow new commers
to join the group/conversation easily and understand the collaboration method
that we apply. Also would like to hold small meetups so the community starts
to know each other and get to meet people in the industry.


### Timing
| Week |              Title              |                                                    Description                                                    |           Status            |
|:----:|:-------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|   3  | Research Similar  Organizations | Look for similar organization on github that use organizations to  manage the group. Analyze what works for them. |    :white_square_button:    |
|   4  | Implement Structure Changes     | After finishing the research on other organizations implement the structure they have in our GH organization.     |    :white_square_button:    |
|   5  | Generate event calendar        | Publish an event calendar on the organization that includes on campus events and off campus events as well.        |    :white_square_button:    |
|   6  | Push Changes & Feedback         | Push changes to GH Organization and receive feedback from  the members.                                           |    :white_square_button:    |

### Community Demographics
For these first steps will be focusing on Computer Engineers since they are
the closest demographic with the availability that others enter as well.

### Goals
  - **Structure, structure, structure**.
  - Event Planning.
  - Improve accesibility for new commers.
  - Recruit **Awesome** People.

### Communication
This shoud be discussed. Though Slack sounds as a tipical answer to communication
problems it can also be the source of people deserting projects.


## Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish.
Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- **Target audience**
  - Computer Engineering Students.
  - Computer Science Students.
- **Community needs**
  - Building a Structure for the Community.
  - Meeting Industry Leaders
  - Develop Real Life Applications.
- **Resources**
  - We know many people from the dev community that could give
  interesting talks.
  - We know people from other communities that could have usefull tips to 
  improve the github organization.
- **Media**
  - The delivery of the proposal will be seen in the Github Organization Page.
  - We could see if life streaming works and ad the links to the meetups in the
  GH repo.
- **Content knowledge**
  - We're well connected in the industry robably would need to investigate more about
  other organizations that take place in GH and their structures.

## Planning for the Future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?

Two weeks after Week 6

- How will you measure success?

By the conversations that take place on the Organization, the number of newcommers, amount of new 
repos in the gitjub organization and meetup assitance.

- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?

Every 2 months.
