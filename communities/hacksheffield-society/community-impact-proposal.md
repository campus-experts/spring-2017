## Summary of the Community's Needs

The community needs solid leadership for the future. 
This requires needs a solid, fundamental vision to look back at and bring future organisers together as teams.

## My Proposal

My proposal is to do with how I am going to support those that are running the society in the future. I am not organising any longer, but I would like to help them. Much of this is on a personal level, not public.

With public work, my priority is to focus on solidifying the goals and vision of the society, and help organisers come together and work as a team.

## My Proposal's Impact

I hope to inspire future organisers to take hold of a vision and progress towards furthering it. As founder, I hope to set out the vision clearly. A constitution of sorts, but something impactful, unlike many society constitutions.
They also need a feeling of teamwork and bonding, and I will look to do anything that makes that feeling stronger.
- Resources

Not many resources needed, I just need to sit down and think about fundamentals.
- Media

I am aiming to publish something in some form. This may be a public blog post, or a private file in the community GitHub organisation. This depends on how my ideas for setting the vision develop.
As for the teamwork and bonding, I will use the GitHub API to generate a public website of the current teams in our GitHub organisation.
I may do some other things if more ideas come in.
- Content knowledge
  - How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
  
    Somewhat, but there are many around the UK that are doing similar things or have done similar things that I could ask.
  - What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?
  
    Contacts.
- Timeline
  - Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.
  
  Publish the item and develop the website generation by the end of the programme. Provide continuous support to past organisers as and when I feel most useful.

## Planning for the Future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?

  I am aiming for defining the society purpose for the future. Impact is something that will always be evolving if the society stays on the original vision.
- How will you measure success?

  If the future society sticks with the vision or evolves it further to do great things for the community.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?

  This is going to be something I write once and do not change. It will be down to future organisers to set their visions for their time running HackSheffield.
